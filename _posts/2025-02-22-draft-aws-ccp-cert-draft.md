Today marks a milestone: I've successfully navigated the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 exam. This journey was a blend of professional experience and dedicated study, a testament to the power of consistent effort. Here's a glimpse into my preparation process.

# The Foundation: A Software Engineer's Perspective

As a software engineer, I've had the privilege of dipping my toes into the AWS ecosystem, working with services like EC2, RDS, and CloudWatch for about a year. While this experience provided a practical understanding, it was just the starting point. It gave me the valuable ability to discern plausible answers from the noise, but the certification demanded a deeper, more comprehensive knowledge.

# The Path to Proficiency: My Study Strategy

1.  **Corporate Training:** I began with an insightful online course provided by my company, laying a solid foundation.
2.  **YouTube Exploration (Partial):** I ventured into a couple of lengthy YouTube tutorials. While I couldn't complete them due to their extensive duration, they offered valuable insights. (Note: Consider linking to general AWS CCP study youtube videos, instead of the googleusercontent links, as they are not helpful.)
3.  **The Power of Practice Exams:** This was the cornerstone of my preparation. I tackled approximately 600-700 questions, embracing repetition as a tool for mastery.
    * **Active Recall:** I approached each question with active recall, guessing the answer before checking.
    * **Deep Dive Learning:** Incorrect answers were not setbacks, but opportunities. I meticulously reviewed the material, ensuring I understood not just the correct answer, but the rationale behind all four options.
    * **Reinforcement:** Correct answers were solidified through memorization and immediate progression.

# Key Areas of Focus

1.  **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF):** The CAF's six perspectives—business, people, governance, platform, security, and operations—were crucial. Understanding their intricacies was key to answering several exam questions. (https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-adoption-framework/)
2.  **Shared Responsibility Model:** Grasping the division of responsibilities between AWS and the user was paramount. The model's core principle—AWS manages infrastructure, while users secure their applications and data—was a recurring theme. (https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)

# The Arsenal of Practice Exams

1.  **O'Reilly's Pearson Practice Test:** The O'Reilly platform (https://learning.oreilly.com/) offered a realistic simulation with its 'AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 (Pearson Practice Test)'. Consistently scoring around 800 became my benchmark for exam readiness. Completing this test eight times (approximately 500 questions) provided invaluable familiarity.
2.  **Kananinirav's GitHub Repository:** This resource (https://github.com/kananinirav/AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner-Notes/blob/master/practice-exam/practice-exam-1.md) proved to be a current and popular tool within the certification community.
3.  **Tutorials Dojo Sample Questions:** While I didn't complete this set (https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-sample-exam-questions/), it offered a valuable collection of questions.
4.  **Simulado CLF:** This platform (https://simuladoclf.s3.amazonaws.com/english.html) provided well-structured questions, perfect for reinforcing foundational concepts.

# Community Insights

The Reddit community (https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/16nsyxx/has_anyone_taken_the_new_aws_cloud_practitioner/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/170bkjy/passed_aws_ccp_clfc02/) was an invaluable source of support and advice. Reading through shared experiences and tips provided a sense of community and direction.

This certification is more than a badge; it's a testament to the dedication required to navigate the complexities of cloud computing. I hope my journey inspires others to embark on their own cloud certification adventures.

This is a story and journey of how I prepared on my AWS Certificed Cloud Practioner CLF-02 exam.

# Background
I am a software engineer and I have been using some of AWS services lightlly at work such as EC2, RDS, and CloudWatch about 1 years. It helps, but it doesn't give me the answer to a question, but it gives an idea what to rule out and what to include as a potential answer.

# Study
1. I took one on-line class offered from my company.
2. I watched the 2 youtube videos, but could not finish because it was too long.
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOTamWNgDKc
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsmhEgIV1mQ
3. The rest is PRACTICE EXAMS. I think went through about 600-700 questions. Some are duplicated, but it helps me to understand and memorize completely.
  - I read a question. Guess the answer (don't look at the answer).
  - If I got it wrong, then go back to study mode and understand. During this process, I natually had to understand all 4 options.
  - If I got it right, memorize and move to a next question. 

# Personal Emphasis
1. There were about 5-6 questions about AWS CAF. There are 6 perspectives  (business, people, governance, platform, security, and operations) and try to undersand completely what each covers. - https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-adoption-framework/
2. There were about 5-6 questions about Shared Responsiblity Model. The basic idea is AWS takes care of all physical & maintanence of infrastructure, but you have to setup users, security of environments, and more - https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/

# Practice Exams
1. Luckly, I had O'Relliy(https://learning.oreilly.com/) subscription and used the 'AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 (Pearson Practice Test)'. This gives me the same feeling of actual test (with 65 questions and 100 minutes). Also, at the end, it tells me if I passed it. If you are getting consistently around 800 scores, consider yourself ready for the exam. I did about 8 times, which is about 500 questions and a decent amount of repeats.
2. I found this useful, up-to-date, and quite popular to this cert community. - https://github.com/kananinirav/AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner-Notes/blob/master/practice-exam/practice-exam-1.md
3. I did not finish, but a good set of questions - https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-sample-exam-questions/
4. Nicely built. Questions are a bit too simple, but good for understanding the concept - https://simuladoclf.s3.amazonaws.com/english.html
