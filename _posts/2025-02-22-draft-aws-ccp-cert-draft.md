My story and journey to AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 exam. 

## Background
Here's a glimpse into my preparation process.
As a software engineer, I've had the privilege of dipping my toes into the AWS ecosystem, working with services like EC2, RDS, and CloudWatch for about a year.

It gave me the valuable ability to discern plausible answers from the noise, but the certification demanded a deeper, more comprehensive knowledge.
