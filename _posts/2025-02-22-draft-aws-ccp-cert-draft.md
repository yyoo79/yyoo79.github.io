This is a story and journey of how I prepared on my AWS Certificed Cloud Practioner CLF-02 exam.

# Background
I am a software engineer and I have been using some of AWS services lightlly at work such as EC2, RDS, and CloudWatch about 1 years. It helps, but it doesn't give me the answer to a question, but it gives an idea what to rule out and what to include as a potential answer.

# Study
1. I took one on-line class offered from my company.
2. I watched the 2 youtube videos, but could not finish because it was too long.

3. The rest is PRACTICE EXAMS. I think went through about 600-700 questions. Some are duplicated, but it helps me to understand and memorize completely.
  - I read a question. Guess the answer (don't look at the answer).
  - If I got it wrong, then go back to study mode and understand. During this process, I natually had to understand all 4 options.
  - If I got it right, memorize and move to a next question. 

# Personal Emphasis
1. There were about 5-6 questions about AWS CAF. There are 6 perspectives  (business, people, governance, platform, security, and operations) and try to undersand completely what each covers. - https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-adoption-framework/
2. There were about 5-6 questions about Shared Responsiblity Model. The basic idea is AWS takes care of all physical & maintanence of infrastructure, but you have to setup users, security of environments, and more - https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/

# Practice Exams
1. Luckly, I had O'Relliy(https://learning.oreilly.com/) subscription and used the 'AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 (Pearson Practice Test)'. This gives me the same feeling of actual test (with 65 questions and 100 minutes). Also, at the end, it tells me if I passed it. If you are getting consistently around 800 scores, consider yourself ready for the exam. I did about 8 times, which is about 500 questions and a decent amount of repeats.
2. I found this useful, up-to-date, and quite popular to this cert community. - https://github.com/kananinirav/AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner-Notes/blob/master/practice-exam/practice-exam-1.md
3. I did not finish, but a good set of questions - https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-sample-exam-questions/
4. Nicely built. Questions are a bit too simple, but good for understanding the concept - https://simuladoclf.s3.amazonaws.com/english.html
