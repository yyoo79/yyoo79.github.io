My story and journey to AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 exam. 

## Background
Here's a glimpse into my preparation process.
As a software engineer, I've had the privilege of dipping my toes into the AWS ecosystem, working with services like EC2, RDS, and CloudWatch for about a year. While this experience provided a practical understanding, it was just the starting point. It gave me the valuable ability to discern plausible answers from the noise, but the certification demanded a deeper, more comprehensive knowledge.

## Study
1. **Training** I took a live & online course provided by my company.
2. **YouTube Exploration (Partial):** I ventured into a couple of lengthy YouTube tutorials. While I couldn't complete them due to their extensive duration, they offered valuable insights.

3. **The Power of Practice Exams:** This was the cornerstone of my preparation. I tackled approximately 600-700 questions, embracing repetition as a tool for mastery.
    * **Active Recall:** I approached each question with active recall, guessing the answer before checking.
    * **Deep Dive Learning:** Incorrect answers were not setbacks, but opportunities. It's time to review the material, ensuring I understood not just the correct answer, but the rationale behind all four options.
    * **Reinforcement:** Correct answers should stick through memorization and immediate progression.

## Key Areas of Focus

1.  **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF):** The CAF's six perspectives—business, people, governance, platform, security, and operations—were crucial. Understanding their detail was key to answering several exam questions. [Link](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-adoption-framework/)
2.  **Shared Responsibility Model:** Grasping the division of responsibilities between AWS and the user was paramount. The model's core principle—AWS manages infrastructure, while users secure their applications and data—was a recurring theme. [Link](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)

## Practice Exams Reference

1.  **O'Reilly's Pearson Practice Test:** NOT FREE. The [O'Reilly platform](https://learning.oreilly.com/) offered a realistic simulation with its 'AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 (Pearson Practice Test)'. Consistently scoring around 800 became my benchmark for exam readiness. Completing this test eight times (approximately 500 questions) provided invaluable familiarity.
2.  **Kananinirav's GitHub Repository:** This [resource](https://github.com/kananinirav/AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner-Notes/blob/master/practice-exam/practice-exam-1.md) proved to be a current and popular tool within the certification community.
3.  **Tutorials Dojo Sample Questions:** While I didn't complete [this set](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-sample-exam-questions/), it offered a valuable collection of questions.
4.  **Simulado CLF:** Nicely built, but couldn't complete this set, either [Link](https://simuladoclf.s3.amazonaws.com/english.html) perfect for reinforcing foundational concepts.
